inherits:
  - !include other.yaml # or [other1.yaml, other2.yaml]
# Files with other bindings that also apply to the node. If an attribute is set
# both in an included file and in the file that includes it, then the value
# from the including file (the file with the !include) is used.

< parent | child >:
# parent/child is used to document implicit relation between nodes.
# This information is required to generate parent related bits in child
# attributes.
# In case parent has 'bus', slave inherits some information from master.
# parent and child should share same bus-type value.
   bus: <bus-type>

sub-node:
# Used for cases in which a dts node has children, and the children dont
# require/specify a 'compatible' property.  The sub-node is effective the
# binding for the child.
#
# Here's an example for a pwm-leds binding in which the child nodes
# would be required to have 'pwms' properties.

    properties:
        pwms:
          type: compound

properties:

# A typical property entry looks like this:
#
#   <name of the property in the device tree - regexes are supported>:
#     category: <required | optional>
#     type: <string | int | boolean | array | uint8-array | string-array | compound>
#     description: <description of property>
#     generation: define
#
# The exact value of the 'generation' attribute is ignored otherwise. The
# output is always #define's.
#
# The 'type' attribute is currently ignored.

# At a minimum, an entry for the 'compatible' property is required, for
# matching nodes
    compatible: <list of string compatible matches>

# If a node is an interrupt controller, GPIO controller, pinmux device, or any
