Zephyr Kernel 2.0.0 (Working Draft)
####################################

We are pleased to announce the release of Zephyr kernel version 2.0.0.

Major enhancements with this release include:

* The kernel now supports both 32- and 64-bit architectures.
* We added support for SOCKS5 proxy. SOCKS5 is an Internet protocol that
  exchanges network packets between a client and server through a proxy server.
* Introduced support for 6LoCAN, a 6Lo adaption layer for Controller Area
  Networks.
* We added support for :ref:`Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) <ppp>`. PPP is a
  data link layer (layer 2) communications protocol used to establish a direct
  connection between two nodes.
* We added support for UpdateHub which is an end-to-end solution for large scale
  over-the-air update of devices.
* We added support for ARM Cortex-R Architecture (EXPERIMENTAL).

The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

Kernel
******

* New kernel API for per-thread disabling of Floating Point Services for
  ARC, ARM Cortex-M, and x86 architectures.
* New system call to set the clock frequency at runtime.
* Additional support for compatibility with 64-bit architectures.
* Userspace mutexes are now supported through the new k_futex primitive.
* Improvements to the slab allocator.
* Fixed the implementation of k_thread_name_set() with userspace enabled.
* Boost the default tick rate for tickless kernels in order to improve the
  precision of timeouts.

Architectures
*************

* ARM:

  * Added initial support for ARM Cortex-R architecture (EXPERIMENTAL)
  * We enhanced the support for Floating Point Services in Cortex-M
    architecture, implementing and enabling lazy-stacking for FPU
    capable threads and fixing stack overflow detection for FPU
    capable supervisor threads
  * Added Qemu support for ARMv8-M Mainline architecture
  * Optimized the IRQ locking time in thread context switch
  * Fixed several critical bugs in User Mode implementation
  * Added test coverage for ARM-specific kernel features
  * Improved support for linking TrustZone Secure Entry functions into
    Non-Secure firmware

* ARC:

  * Added support for ARC HS architecture
  * Added SMP support for ARC HS architecture
  * Added support for ARC SecureShield based TEE (EXPERIMENTAL)
  * Fixed several critical bugs in interrupt and exception handling
  * Enhance the support for Floating Point Services

* POSIX:

  * Fix race condition with terminated threads which had never been
    scheduled by kernel. On very loaded systems it could cause swap errors.

* x86:

  * Support for the Quark microcontroller family has been dropped.
  * A new lightweight PCI implementation has been introduced which supports
    MSI and other features required for PCIe devices. The previous PCI
    implementation has been deprecated and will be removed in 2.1.
